# Glance
A slim Pandas extension for having a quick Glance at datasets.

## Why
When you get a new dataset there are many first operation you do and, often, they are quite the same. For this reason I thought about writing this little module along the way, expanding such wonderful Pandas package.


## How to install it
As you can see, at the moment, is a simple module that you can move into your working folder and import.

## How to use it
Here is an example<br>
        <br>>>>df = pd.read_csv( filename )
        <br>>>>df = df.glance.glance()
        <br>>>>df.glance.notnull()
